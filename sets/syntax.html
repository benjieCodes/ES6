    <h1>Sets</h1>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>A unique array (can only add item once) which is a list of items to add, remove, and loop over</p>
    <script>
        const people = new Set();
        people.add('Benjie');
        people.add('Anna');

        people.add('Rachel');
        // to delete an item you don't need to find the index/location
        people.delete('Benjie');
        people.values();
        people.add('Anna') // doesn't do anything because items are unique
        people[0] // returns undefined because there's no index

        const it = people.values();
        it.next();
        it.next();
        it.next();
        for (const person of people) {

        const dogs = ['Jax', 'Snickers'];
